# Neovim configuration

Obviously in a constant state of flux and optimized for my own workflow. Sometimes uses features from the latest nightly builds of Neovim.

- Keymaps are in `lua/keymaps.lua`
- Options are in `lua/options.lua`

Aside from that all plugins are configured using separate files in the `lua/plugins` directory.
